# Let's draw online

This is a simple app for drawing with others online, demonstrating socket.io, express and Node.js.

You can check it out at one of these places:

-   https://lets-draw.onrender.com
-   https://jh4b6.sse.codesandbox.io/

In the control panel on the right, you can choose the line width, choose one of 18 colors and clear the canvas - which clears it for all users. You can also see the number of current users.

As long as the server is running, the drawing is saved on it. So when you close the window and open it again, your drawing should be restored. Also, new users can see what previous users have drawn.
